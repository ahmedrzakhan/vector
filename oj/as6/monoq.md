The condition len(str)-i+len(stack) > K is a crucial part of the algorithm to ensure that we only pop characters from the stack when it is safe to do so â€“ that is, when we can still construct a subsequence of the desired length K after the pop.

Let's break down the components of this condition:

len(str) - i: This is the number of characters remaining in the string str that we have not yet iterated over. It's calculated by subtracting the current index i from the total length of the string len(str).

len(stack): This is the current size of the stack, which is the number of characters we have currently in our subsequence.

len(str) - i + len(stack): By adding the number of characters remaining (len(str) - i) to the size of the stack (len(stack)), we get the maximum possible length of the subsequence we can still build if we were to use all the remaining characters plus the characters currently in the stack.

len(str) - i + len(stack) > K: We want to ensure that after popping a character from the stack, we still have enough characters left (in the stack and the remainder of the string) to reach our target length K. If this condition is true, it means that we can safely pop a character from the stack because we can still achieve a subsequence of length K.

If this condition is not true (meaning that len(str) - i + len(stack) <= K), then we cannot afford to pop any more characters from the stack, because doing so would mean we would not be able to reach the desired subsequence length K.
